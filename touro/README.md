I did a great job recreating this design (I think ðŸ˜…) but, I had issues recreating some design elements mainly because I don't have acess to the exact images and icons, all in all I tried my best to recreate the design. Another issue I faced is alignment the design dosen't look aligned much but I tried my best to recreate the feel. Another issue I faced is makingt the site mobile responsive, well to recreate this design I don't realy need to but i dicided to do it to challenge my self ðŸ¦¾, i guess i did a good job at that not a great job but good enough I guess ðŸ˜… the hero section looks oddly aligned on tablets but that somthing to overlook right ðŸ¤”.

After complition i notice i didn't manage svg's well, my svg icons are too inconsistent in stroke and size. i need another solution for svg's also i didn't manage images well (i mean the sizes of the images), and lastly i'll need to work on how i organise my CSS...you'll notice i tried using BEM ðŸ˜….

i might consider adding scroll driving animations later but my goal was just to recreate the design.
